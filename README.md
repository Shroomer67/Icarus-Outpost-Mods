# Icarus-Outpost-Mods

Right now I only have two mods for outopst.

Full_Map_Outposts_P.pak mod will include the full map playable as a outpost.
By selecting Arcwood you will drop in at the Beachead Recon Drop Zone.
IceHolm will drop you at Life Line Construction and Holdfast at Agricultural Stockpile.
All of this shows up in game. When you select the Outpost it will tell you where you are droping in at.
Weather is set to the lowest wilth damage. Experience is set to 100%. Everything else is as full map.

Live Outposts_P.pak keeps the standard outposts but adds 100% XP, weather, Bitting fish, Cave worms, And all the typical animals of the full map.

When you download the file you have to place it inside the mods folder in Icarus

The file will be in your Downloads folder unless you specifed somewhere else.

Go to Steam and right click on Icarus in the Installed games list.
move down to Manage and select Browse local files.
Open the Icarus folder you see just above the Icarus exicutable file.
Open the Content folder and then the Paks folder.
Right click and create a subfolder named "mods" all lower case.
Copy your downloaded mod to the folder you just created.
Start the game and enjoy.
