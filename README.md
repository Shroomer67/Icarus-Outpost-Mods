# Icarus-Outpost-Mods

Discord to get help with other mods https://discord.gg/2UrWDXjxUk

Right now I only have three mods for outopst. Intended for offline play (use at your own risk online)

Full_Map_Outposts_P.pak mod will include the full map playable as a outpost.
By selecting Arcwood you will drop in at the Beachead Recon Drop Zone.
IceHolm will drop you at Spirit Walk : Exploration and Holdfast at Voyager : Recovery.
All of this shows up in game. When you select the Outpost it will tell you where you are droping in at.
Weather is set to the lowest wilth damage (LightWeather). Experience is set to 100%. Everything else is as full map on that mission.

Live Outposts_P.pak keeps the standard outposts but adds 100% XP, weather (lightWeather), Bitting fish, Cave worms, And all the typical animals of the full Biome.

Extra Creatures Outpost_P.pak mod for special creatures some work some don't but that should get fixed soon. Have fun with it.

When you download the file you have to place it inside the mods folder in Icarus

The file will be in your Downloads folder unless you specifed somewhere else.

Go to Steam and right click on Icarus in the Installed games list.
move down to Manage and select Browse local files.
Open the Icarus folder you see just above the Icarus exicutable file.
Open the Content folder and then the Paks folder.
Right click and create a subfolder named "mods" all lower case.
Copy your downloaded mod to the folder you just created.
Start the game and enjoy.

I will not reply to any questions for online play. This mod was designed with OFFLINE outpost in mind. Please do not use this mod online, You may be the cause of another player loosing his Character (Toon). You can not predict what it could cause online so again please do not use this mod online. If you share the mod with someone please make sure they understand that they should not use this for online play.
